							<h2>Taking the Knowledge Sharing Campaign to the Next Level</h2>
						</header>
						<p align="justify">African development does not depend on our endless hopes from the East or West. Any society that cares about its future, must invest in its youth. A key strategic area that Africa needs to invest on is Education, especially by providing the youth with accessible quality education. Once we achieve this, the African youth, whose role is key, will be empowered enough to provide their input and contribute to the development of Africa. Armed with our passion to empower the African student diaspora, we launched the Knowledge Sharing Campaign (KSC). In this article, we share a few success stories, even as we work on KSC’s expansion strategy.</p>
						<p align="justify">The Knowledge Sharing Campaign is a community platform that brings together two groups of people: the Know & Can Teach (those who have experience and can share their knowledge) group and the Don’t Know & Can Learn (those who are eager to learn, but lack opportunities) group. KSC originated from a simple idea, which turned out to be its slogan: 'Bring, Share & Learn'.</p>
