						<p align="justify">Our Co-Founder, Paulcy is a passionate young African who believes in the power of Quality Education. Armed with his passion to promote the love and access to quality education for young Africans, he initiated the Knowledge Sharing Campaign (KSC) primarily to address a well-known problem that he is in a better position to explain. During his stay in Hyderabad, Paulcy was the President of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/congo-brazzaville-students-association-cobsa-paulcy-mboungou/">COBSA</a> (Congo Brazzaville Students Association - Hyderabad Chapter), he realised that there is a huge community of African students like him facing three big problems.</p>
						<p align="justify">He was selected from over 2000 African highest-potential young people, and have completed courses in big data, machine learning and design thinking among others. He worked as Scrum Master for the Congolese edition of the Pan-African Africa Science Week (NEF) where he ensured that the entire project was delivered on-time and managed efficiently. His experience delivering software using Agile at ThoughtWorks taught him how best to implement Agile and its benefits. Working with ThoughtWorks gave him the experience and confidence to work in an agile, dynamic, fast-paced organization where learning quickly and pitching are keys instrumental to success. Building on his academic skills in programming and exposure to technology at large, Paulcy believes that technology is shaping the face of tomorrow’s world with initiatives like smart cities. His long-term goal is to be amongst the young Africans passionate about driving positive change that is needed for Africa's transformation and social economic development.</p>
						<p align="justify">Paulcy is more interested in educating himself more on what it takes to change Africans mindset from being consumers of technology to start contributing to the creation of software that solves African problems.</p>
