Mathematics and computer science have evolved into a matter of utmost importance in our modern society. We are confronted with the product of mathematical and computational research in all situations and aspects of our daily lives. To ensure that this technical revolution continues to thrive, science in all of its facets has to be persistently promoted and encouraged. The Knowledge Sharing Campaign (KSC) rises to this challenge by bringing together the most exceptional mathematicians and computer scientists of their generations. Each year, in the last complete week of September, the recipients of the most prestigious awards in mathematics and computer science, meet 200 selected young researchers from all over the world. Participants spend a week interacting and networking in a relaxed atmosphere designed to encourage scientific exchange.
