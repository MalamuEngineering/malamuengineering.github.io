									<h3>MALAMU | Your Mobile Passport to Health.</h3>
									<p align="justify">A busy and forgetful  traveller that is HIV positive <code>needs to</code> find a way to carry his medical history information with him at all times <code>because</code> it is necessary for him to be able to access his drugs or seek medical help whereever he is.</p>
									
									<p align="justify">In Africa, public hospitals are flooded with long queues of patients seeking medical assistance. Patients travel from very close and distant places to health centers, sometimes leaving their homesteads at very early hours of the morning. Even with the hope of being the first in line, many end up disappointed.</p>

									<p align="justify">Queues make up for the larger part of a hospital visit. Sometimes patients are compelled to queue outside waiting rooms in access healthcare. Though it’s not a single queue that leads to long waiting hours in health centers – there is a number of smaller queues involved: front desk, patient file retrival, X-ray, blood test and many more.</p>

									<p align="justify">One study <sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3644748/">1</a></sup> claims that majority of patients (78.1%) spend 2 hours or less on the queue before being seen by doctor, and less than 1 hour to actually see the doctor. For something as time-sensitive as healthcare, this spells disaster. And patients know as much.</p>

									<p align="justify">Health officers most times have to go through huge stocks and piles of folders to retrieve patient folders which sometimes becomes fraustrating and leads to long waiting hours.</p>

									<p align="justify">Every aspect of patient experience – from confidence in the care provider to perceived service quality – correlates negatively with longer wait times. This dissatisfaction affects not only the patients’ mood, but the working environment in general.</p>

									<!-- Blockquote -->
									<blockquote>Worse still, it affects their health as well. Long wait time can lead to adverse health effects such as stress, anxiety or pain.</blockquote>

									<h3>PROBLEM SPACE MAP</h3>
									<div class="row">
										<ol>
											<li>Lack of Technology "know-how".</li>
											<li>Inadequate investment into health care.</li>
											<li>long queues & waiting time.</li>
											<li>Disease Management.</li>
											<li>loss of lives.</li>
											<li>Government and Health Policies.</li>
										</ol>
									</div>
									<p align="justify">Disability Life Adjusted Years (DALYs) are a measure of the burden of disease attributable to underserved communites and effects on the person’s life general. In Africa as at 2004 TB accounted for 10.8 million DALY’s lost. With the highest TB incidence in Africa and with a 2015 national budget of USD 257 million, Nigeria can do well with a less primitive record keeping system. This also results in overworked and frustrated staff, and poor quality of care.</p>
									<h4>Quicker service and shorter queues would result in increased productivity, a lower burden of disease and more efficient health care delivery</h4>
									<dl>
										<dt>Reduce the queues</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Nowadays organisations need a trusted catalyst to help them transform how they serve consumers-one that brings new and innovative ideas every day.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Upgrade record keeping</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>The hospital administration is able to securely store a users medical records such as diagnosis and medical prescriptions into an electronic database.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>And save lives.</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>One advantage of this method of data storage is that, the patient is able to retrieve his medical record and be offered medical treatment in any geographic location.</p>

										Not having a centralized location to store patient data that is of crucial importance for doctors to make sound medical decisions about your life where ever you may be in the world. So if a doctor does not know your medical history they are more likely inclined to make a bad judgment.
									</p>
									<p>
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/14.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Having a centralized location that transcends physical country borders would assist medical practitioners make better judgments about prescriptions and so forth. The technology used to make the centralized area could also be used as a means of cutting the queuing time in hospitals

									<h3>Who is Malamu being sold to?</h3>
									<div class="box">
										<p>Both civilians and health care institutions. We should be very clear with this. That both Malamu clients are the health care institutions since they need to register on the platform and also the patients, since they need to be willing to pay for these services in order to have their data stored in the system.</p>
